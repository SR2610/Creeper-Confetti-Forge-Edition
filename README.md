A Minecraft modification for replacing creeper explosions with harmless confetti.  
  
More information as well as downloads available on the [Curse Forge Page](http://sr2610.com/mods/confetti.html).

This within was previously located within the [MicroMods Repository](https://github.com/SR2610/MicroMods) but has been moved to an individual repository to make it easier to maintain in the future.

Many thanks to both [RoCoKo](https://github.com/RoCoKo) for contributing with both additional language files and [Neonit](https://github.com/Neonit) for contributing a bugfix.
